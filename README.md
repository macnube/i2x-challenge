##Deployment instructions

- clone repo
- npm install
- To run locally:
  - use terminal and from root directory of repo run `npm start`. This will run webpack dev server that allows for hot reloading
  - use terminal and from root directory of repo run `npm prod`. This will run express server locally on localhost:8080. Will be using express server running off of the build file.
- To make edits to build directory, make necessary changes and then run `npm build`.
